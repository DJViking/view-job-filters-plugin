# Jenkins View Job Filters Plugin

Manage multiple views and hundreds of jobs much more easily. This plug-in provides more ways to
include/exclude jobs from a view, including filtering by SCM path, and by any job or build status type, as well
as "chaining" of filters and negating filters.

## Development

Clone the repository then execute the following in the project's root directory:

```
$ mvn hpi:run
```
