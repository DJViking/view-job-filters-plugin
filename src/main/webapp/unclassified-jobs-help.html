<div>
This filter allows a View to show all Jobs that haven't already been included in another View (not counting any "All Jobs" views).
<br/><br/>
This is especially useful if you have hundreds of Jobs organized into Views, and you want an easy way to identify
which Jobs haven't been "classified" into a View yet. 
<br/><br/>
Note: because this filter looks at other views, there is a risk of creating circular references between views
which can lead to unpredictable behavior. This filter will warn you if that's the case.
